| List               | `List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);` | `let list: [Int] = [1, 2, 3]`      | `list = [1, 2, 3]`                            |
| Dictionary/Map     | `Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();` | `let dict: [String: Int] = ["a": 1, "b": 2]` | `dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2}` |
| Set                | `Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();`    | `let set: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3]`          | `set = {1, 2, 3}`                            |
| Tuple              | N/A                                      | `let tuple: (Int, String) = (1, "one")`  | `tuple = (1, "one")`                         |
| Null/None          | `String s = null;`                       | `let s: String? = nil`                   | `s = None`                                   |

## Language Specific Notes

- **Java**:
  - Java requires explicit type declarations.
  - `float` values must be suffixed with `f` (e.g., `10.0f`).
  
- **Swift**:
  - Swift uses `let` for constants and `var` for variables.
  - Swift requires type annotations when declaring variables with `let` and `var` if the type cannot be inferred.
  
- **Python**:
  - Python uses dynamic typing, so types are inferred at runtime.
  - No need to explicitly declare types when assigning values.

- **Boolean**:
  - `boolean` in Java, `Bool` in Swift, and `bool` in Python. Note that Python uses `True` and `False` with capital letters.
  
- **Array**:
  - In Java, arrays are fixed in size and defined with square brackets.
  - In Swift, arrays are defined with square brackets, and the type is specified as `[Type]`.
  - In Python, lists are the closest equivalent to arrays in Java and Swift, but Python lists are dynamic (they can grow and shrink in size).

- **List**:
  - Java uses `List` (an interface), often implemented by `ArrayList` or `LinkedList`.
  - Swift uses arrays or more complex collections.
  - Python uses lists, which are highly flexible.

- **Dictionary/Map**:
  - In Java, `Map` is an interface, with `HashMap` being a common implementation.
  - Swift uses dictionaries, which are defined as `[Key: Value]`.
  - Python uses dictionaries, which are highly versatile.

- **Set**:
  - In Java, `Set` is an interface, with `HashSet` as a common implementation.
  - Swift uses the `Set` type, defined as `Set<Type>`.
  - Python uses the built-in `set` type.

- **Tuple**:
  - Tuples are not directly available in Java (but can be implemented using classes or pairs).
  - Swift and Python both support tuples directly. Swift uses `(Type1, Type2)` for tuple types, while Python uses `(value1, value2)`.

- **Null/None**:
  - In Java, `null` is used to represent the absence of a value.
  - Swift uses `nil` to represent the absence of a value, typically in optionals (`Type?`).
  - Python uses `None` to represent the absence of a value.

## Summary

This table shows how different languages handle variable declarations for basic data types, with Python being the most flexible due to its dynamic typing system, while Java and Swift require more explicit type declarations.
